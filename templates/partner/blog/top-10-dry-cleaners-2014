<h1>Top 10 Dry Cleaners in London 2014.</h1>

<i>More than 50 cleaners were shortlisted, including a number of big brands. Here is the definitive top 10. These cleaners achieved our highest internal rating - 5/5. They are presented here in no particular order. Cleaners were judged on service, quality of finish, speed, and value.</i>

<p>We spoke to owners, staff, and customers, and the surprising results are in&#8230;.</p>

<h2>Kensington Valet</h2>

<p>How does a business survive in one of the most competitive areas of London? If Kensington Valet are anything to go by, it&rsquo;s by working hard and putting your customers first. We saw the staff working tirelessly to achieve top results for their customers. There&rsquo;s a real energy to the store that is perhaps a trait of the Notting Hill area. Nevertheless - it seems to be working.</p>

<p>This was evident in the constant stream of customers through the door. Kensington Valet&rsquo;s reputation has even attracted customers away from nearby competitors. We get the feeling that customers are treated with the same warmth, care, and attention that their clothes get. The owner says: &ldquo;a lot of cleaners are out to just take the customer&rsquo;s money. It&rsquo;s an attitude that just doesn&rsquo;t work in the long term&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Sicilliana</h2>

<p>Whatever you get cleaned, value for money is important. Thankfully, Siciliana boast some of the best prices in London. But with prices like that, we were totally shocked by the business that we came to see&#8230;</p>

<p>Sicilliana is charmingly named after the wife of the couple that run the store. We didn&rsquo;t entirely understand how their could set their prices so well - and half expected it to be an amature &ldquo;home-based&rdquo; operation. But then we walked in the store, and to our pleasant surprise it was one of the more tidy, clean, tightly run operations that we&rsquo;ve seen. We were also impressed by the high-quality finish achieved.</p>

<h2>Super Clean</h2>

<p>Super Clean is a high quality family-run dry cleaners whose owners have more than 30 years of experience. Boasting reasonable prices, a tidy shop, and friendly service, the end result is fast, high-quality dry cleaning service.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s their secret? We did note the staff are some of the hardest working in the industry. When 4/5 businesses don&rsquo;t survive 5 years, the fact that they are still going strong after 30 suggests that this might be the key.</p>

<h2>Mercury Dry Cleaners</h2>

<p>We sometimes have concerns about the way deliveries work. Would it be inconvenient? Would we be left waiting? Mercury showed us how it was done, making the top 10 after an extremely professional delivery. Other cleaners take note! Our driver called ahead to tell us exactly when he would arrive, turned up exactly when he said he would - which was great for us - and our transaction was handled in a couple of seconds. It made it incredibly easy.</p>

<p>On a visit to the store, we met some of the happiest customers we&rsquo;ve yet seen. The owner is friendly, easy to get along with, and quickly helped customers with whatever they needed. We&rsquo;re not surprised to hear rumours of rapid expansion. We feel Mercury is professional, friendly, fast, and easy.</p>

<h2>Washington</h2>

<p>The Mayfair-based shop has great prices - especially given the location. This has probably helped secure Washington as favourite of travellers who would rather not pay the inflated hotel-prices for dry-cleaning. But what particularly impressed us was the staff.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an undeniable friendliness to the shop. Outside, a chair and table provide a place for conversation. Ahead of you in the shop, you&rsquo;re presented with a wall of customer&rsquo;s business cards, willingly given. In the brief time that we met the owner, we were impressed with his casual generosity and helpful tips, an attitude that has clearly filtered into his whole operation. </p>

<p>We also took note of the steps that he&rsquo;s taken to provide better-than-ordinary service. As well as in top cleaning equipment, The owner invested a specialist delivery van, imported from Japan, and is able to service customers in multiple languages. Not many cleaners can claim that&#8230;</p>

<h2>Atlantis Dry Cleaners</h2>

<p>Atlantis Dry Cleaners in 4 words: meticulous attention to quality. Our cleaner showed us clothes that were about to be washed a second or even third time in order to get them absolutely &ldquo;as-new&rdquo; perfect (don&rsquo;t worry - unlike normal washing, dry cleaning doesn&rsquo;t damage your clothes after repeated washes). He pointed out marks on garments that an untrained eye would never spot, even up close. The next minute he shows why two similar looking t-shirts from different designers, for the best results, will be washed in completely different ways. That&rsquo;s experience for you!</p>

<p>And yet, the prices here are very reasonable. The owner confessed that unfortunately people tend to stick with him - he&rsquo;s even had to deliver the odd job across London because customers often don&rsquo;t want to change cleaners after they move.</p>

<h2>Tower Bridge Dry Cleaners</h2>

<p>Hard work pays off</p>

<p>The owners at Tower Bridge both work hard and work smart&#8230; and it&rsquo;s working for their customers. From owning nothing to success, Tower Bridge dry cleaners have made simple improvements to business of Dry Cleaning, and it&rsquo;s brought them a large, loyal following across London.</p>

<p>The founders started out life in the back room of a large laundry house, pressing hundreds of shirts a day. Working hard they taught themselves to master every tool in the store, and spent a long time on the front desk talking to customers, finding out what they really need. It was this time on the desk that inspired their belief that keeping customers happy is the number 1 priority. </p>

<p>With their earnings, the founders invested in a small store. The small store became a big one, then many ones - and today they also have a warehouse-sized workshop in the heart of London that allows their staff to clean hundreds of shirts an hour and still deliver same-day service.</p>

<p>What we liked was the attention to detail that only comes from working for many years in the industry. Rather than stuffing multiple shirts in a bag like some cleaners do, shirts are individually wrapped for longer freshness. Staff are carefully selected and given a great deal of oversight and training to ensure that every single shirt is done properly. Looking at the thousands of items in the workshop, it&rsquo;s clearly paying off.</p>

<h2>Master Dry Cleaners</h2>

<p>Your shirt, cleaned at Master, might be serviced by 10 people. The workshop reminded us of a hive of bees - with many specialists on a variety of machines doing many things. And yet, perhaps thanks to decades of experience, then never lose a button.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the advantage? For one, they are able to clean their large volumes of clothes on-site and quickly. Second, it allows the staff to build up skills in their specialist area, delivering a higher quality result.</p>

<h2>Ivy - The Ultimate Dry Cleaner.<h2>

<p>Charming team &amp; owner. Clean, well run shop.</p>

<p>The Ivy store has the look and feel of a national chain. The place was cleaner than a hospital and well lit. Every detail in the shop has it&rsquo;s proper place, down to leaflets on the counter, tidy, tastefully spaced&#8230; little details that showed us that this was a well run business. But then you speak to the staff and get a very different impression&#8230;</p>

<p>But not a bad one! Rather, that the people you speak to are on your side. Rather than being handled in a chain-store by a customer-service rep with no connection with the cleaning, here, the team is a real unit. The fact that the owner helps run the store day-to-day clearly has an impact on the culture there. After a customer lost their receipt, we saw the whole team work-together to find the items needed. They shared work between them and the customer soon walked away with her dress, very happy.</p>

<p>The prices, too, are better value for money than the major chains. That&rsquo;s not bad either!</p>

<h2>Look New Dry Cleaners</h2>

<p>So&#8230; your trousers are at the cleaners and delivery is arranged for later today, when - disaster! - you&rsquo;re suddenly put on child-minding duty and won&rsquo;t be at home for the delivery. This was exactly the problem one customer faced when she called Look New Dry Cleaners during our interview with it&rsquo;s owner. But the owner&rsquo;s schedule was full. What did he do?</p>

<p>First, a little background on Look New. If you&rsquo;re looking for quality, you&rsquo;ve found it. The experienced owner has managed over 300 branches. It&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;re in safe hands.</p>

<p>With the customer, despite an already busy schedule, the owner immediately changed his plans to accommodate the new delivery time. This is clearly a cleaner who would go out of his way to help customers, and who can accommodate difficult situations.</p>

<h3>Honourable mention:</h3>

<h2>Royal Dry Cleaners</h2>

<p>Royal Dry cleaners is well-run family business. They run multiple stores that provide fast, on-site cleaning. We were impressed by their reliable, customer-focussed approach. That is - when we managed to get a word in! Suffice to say, Royal had a busy shop. From the counter, you can see 50 feet of rails hanging dry cleaning, while up to two people were needed to man the till or fetch items.</p>

<p>Royal&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t reinventing the industry - but simply by providing high-value dry cleaning at a reasonable cost, every time, they seem to be doing very well. Easy to say, hard to do. So for that, we couldn&rsquo;t leave them out. Instead, we tip our hats (and stick them in as an honourable mention).</p>
