<h3>Terms of Use</h3>

<p>Last updated: June 18, 2014</p>

<p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully.

<br>
<h4>Enjoy a life free from laundry</h4>
<p>The words below are meant to support this rule. It allows us to continue providing and improving our Services, and it helps to ensure that a few mean users don't ruin the service for everyone else. You part in that is simple. Just use common sense - respect your cleaner, and recognise that cleaners often have 35 - 40 years of experience and will know when a stain won't come out. Simply respect them and their businesses. We present this rule with a tip of the hat to Snapchat, Inc, whose Terms of Service rule "Have Fun" inspires this one.</p>
